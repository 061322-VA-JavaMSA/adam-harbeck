        <p>Hello, my name is Adam Harbeck and Iâ€™m a front-end and full stack developer from Seattle, Washington. I enjoy using words to weave the fabric of websites.</p>
        <p>When not working on the weave, I enjoy baking, playing video and board games, and spending time with my husband and our pitbull Fergus.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in the full spectrum of programming including mobile apps and games as well as web development.</p>
